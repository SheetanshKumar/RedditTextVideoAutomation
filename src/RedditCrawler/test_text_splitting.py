Tornado Alley seems to have shifted east and a bit more south in the years since I was a toddler but tornados were a serious seasonal threat of which even at a young age I was very aware of. I remember standing on the steps of our trailer watching them far off in the distance. Scared the crap out of me. One evening I was outside with my mom and our next door neighbor. A thunderstorm was blowing in and I was upset and worried. My mom and neighbor said not to worry because the thunder was just God unloading potatoes out of his dump truck. And the lightning? He's gotta back up you know... We went inside, had a bit of rain but nothing else happened. Or so I thought. Turns out our neighbor had gone back outside and scattered potatoes all over her yard and ours leaving me to find all of them the next morning when I went out to play. I believed that stuff until 8th grade."""
